<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Tong. I have a Phd in Asian studies from the University of Edinburgh. My research area is comparative literature and postcolonial studies.</p>

<p>I am a keen learner of languages and literature. I am also very interested in coding - the progress of coding and being able to see the outcome of the coding words are like magic to me. I think coding has many in common with literature - to create, to transfer, and to affect.</p>

<p>I hope you will find my learning progress motivating, and I will keep updating the little projects I have been working on.</p>
